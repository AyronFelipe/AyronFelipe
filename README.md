  Hey you! Well, I've been working with programming since 2016, from that time until now I've been through a lot (believe me :persevere:). I already worked with python and your incredible ecossytem, made crazy things with JavaScript, I've spent nights awake implementing features <s>(not proud)</s>, and some other things you must have gone through too. But, I believe these are things we have to go through to get where we want.
</p>

<p>I like code, films, series, music, anime. A nerd to the core.</p>

<p>I think that's it, good luck to you.</p>
